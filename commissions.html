    <h2>What I Offer</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a traditional illustrator and painter specializing in custom artwork for musicians and creatives. My primary focus is painting and customizing instruments â€” from guitars and drumheads to ukuleles and amps. I also create watercolor portraits, merch design for bands, and offer a range of bespoke illustration work.</p>
    <p>If you have a unique project or idea in mind, Iâ€™d love to hear about it!</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>My commission rate starts at <strong>$50/hour</strong>. Most custom instrument painting projects begin at <strong>$300+</strong> depending on complexity, materials, and surface size.</p>
    <p>For smaller pieces such as watercolor portraits or band merch illustrations, pricing varies â€” please reach out with details for a custom quote.</p>
    <p>Payment is accepted via PayPal. Iâ€™ll provide an estimate and invoice after we confirm your request.</p>
